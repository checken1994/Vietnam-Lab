"""Speculative branching: race N patch candidates against the test suite.

[S3-SECURITY-SWEEP] Hardening (HIGH path-traversal fix): the target file
flows into copy/write sinks, so it is validated (no parent-directory
components, must be an existing file) and resolved to an absolute path
before use. The per-branch backup name is derived from the resolved target,
so no traversal is possible through the backup path either.

STATUS (2026-09-26): DEMO-ONLY / NOT WIRED into the autofix engine — the only
callers are tests (tests/T03_capability/test_security_sweep_s3.py). Known
limitations that keep it out of production wiring:
  1. The candidate patch is written into the LIVE target file while pytest
     runs, so concurrent readers observe uncommitted content during the test
     window. A production integration must race candidates in an isolated
     worktree/sandbox copy instead of the live file.
  2. `pytest` inherits the current working directory and runs whatever suite
     it finds there.
Do NOT delete this module (it is the reference implementation for the
speculative-branching concept and is regression-covered); wire it only after
fixing limitation 1.

[XPROC-TIMEOUT 2026-09-26] The pytest subprocess is bounded by
_SPECULATIVE_TEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: a hung suite fails that branch (logged,
file restored by the finally block) instead of hanging the caller forever.
