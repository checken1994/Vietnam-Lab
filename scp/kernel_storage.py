"""Persistence boundary for :class:`scp.task_kernel.TaskKernel`.

``TaskKernel`` owns task semantics and SQL projections.  This module owns the
database lifecycle: connections, transaction serialization, backend exception
translation, and online backup.  Keeping SQL projections in the kernel is an
intentional incremental boundary; a non-SQL backend would also require a
repository/query contract, not merely a connection adapter.

``TaskKernel(db_path)`` remains backward compatible, while
``TaskKernel(storage=...)`` makes the persistence lifecycle injectable and
testable without exposing SQLite locks or connections to the kernel.
