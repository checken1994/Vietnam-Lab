[OPT-14] ExternalTrustRoot — Gà §8: "Gốc tin cậy bên ngoài"

WHY re-implement: was 9-line stub returning True always.
Proper implementation needs:
  - Verify external audit tests exist and pass
  - Verify CI/CD pipeline exists
  - Verify constitution file exists and is human-approved
  - Check file integrity (hasn't been modified by SCP)

Wired into: scp/api_server.py (startup check — if external trust broken, warn)

# an auto-added copyright notice — passed the "human-approved" check. The trust
# root was forgeable by SCP itself (DNA #6 violation; DNA #22 PASS≠TRUE).

# the FIRST non-empty/non-shebang line of the file. Case-sensitive, name
# non-empty, date must be a valid YYYY-MM-DD.
