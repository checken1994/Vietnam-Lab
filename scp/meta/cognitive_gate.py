 Cognitive Gate — Cognitive layers AFFECT VERDICT.

Trước V45: MetaFalsifier/CounterQuestion/ProofGraph chỉ display, không affect verdict
V45: Cognitive Gate downgrade verdict khi:
  - MetaFalsifier: plan thiếu ≥2 critical attack vectors → PASS → UNKNOWN
  - ProofGraph: overall_status = "broken" → PASS → UNKNOWN
  - CounterQuestion: phát hiện ambiguity → PASS → PARTIAL
  - RecursiveWhy: depth < 1 (chưa trace tới axiom) → PASS → PARTIAL

 Improvements:
  - RecursiveWhy returns "trusted_source" for PubChem/CODATA/etc → no more downgrade
  - Domain-specific CRITICAL_VECTORS for medical/legal/arts/sports/tech (V46 domains)
  - CognitiveGate logs every downgrade to DB (cognitive_gate_log table)
  - Auto false_downgrade_rate tracking (ReVerify feedback)
