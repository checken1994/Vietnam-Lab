"""
[OPT-19] Military — DomainExpert for military (uses existing MilitaryDataSource).

SCP's "SLM" means "Specialized Logic Module" (deterministic dispatcher).
This SLM:
  1. Checks local knowledge (military ranks, doctrines, history basics)
  2. Falls back to MilitaryDataSource.fetch() for specific entities
  3. Returns SLMResponse with answer + confidence + source

NOTE: Distinct from existing Military (_Domain) — this version has
explicit local knowledge for military concepts and ranks.
