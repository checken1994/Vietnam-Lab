[OPT-20] Agriculture — DomainExpert for agriculture (uses existing AgricultureDataSource).

SCP's "SLM" means "Specialized Logic Module" (deterministic dispatcher).
This SLM:
  1. Checks local knowledge (crop yields, farming basics)
  2. Falls back to AgricultureDataSource.fetch() for specific entities
  3. Returns SLMResponse with answer + confidence + source
