[OPT-18] Education — DomainExpert for education (uses ERIC DataSource).

SCP's "SLM" means "Specialized Logic Module" (deterministic dispatcher).
This SLM:
  1. Checks local knowledge (pedagogy, learning theory basics)
  2. Falls back to ERIC DataSource for research papers
  3. Returns SLMResponse with answer + confidence + source

NOTE: Distinct from existing Education (_Domain) — this version uses
the new ERIC API + has explicit local knowledge for education concepts.
