[OPT-21] Art — DomainExpert for art (uses existing ArtsDataSource).

SCP's "SLM" means "Specialized Logic Module" (deterministic dispatcher).
This SLM:
  1. Checks local knowledge (art movements, famous artists, techniques)
  2. Falls back to ArtsDataSource.fetch() for specific entities
  3. Returns SLMResponse with answer + confidence + source

NOTE: Distinct from existing Arts (_Domain) — this version has explicit
local knowledge for art movements and famous artists.
