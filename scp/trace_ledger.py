    """Append-only, hash-chained JSONL audit ledger.

    Tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-PROOF (see trust note at the end).

    Concurrency model
    -----------------
    - In-process: one RLock per canonical path (threads serialize).
    - Cross-process: EVERY append re-reads the tail and writes while holding
      an OS-level exclusive lock on a dedicated ``<path>.lock`` file (msvcrt
      on Windows, fcntl.flock on POSIX; RuntimeError if neither exists —
      fail-closed). Two processes therefore can no longer fork the chain by
      appending concurrently (root cause of the 2026-09-23
      data/trace_ledger.jsonl corruption: two processes appended at the same
      seq with divergent prev_hash, misaligning 808+ entries).
    - The tail is re-read under the cross-process lock on EVERY append, so a
      process never reuses a stale seq after another process appended.
    - verify() reads WITHOUT the OS lock (report-only; a concurrent in-flight
      line may rarely be observed as a parse error — fail-loud, never silent).

    Corruption policy — CHAIN_RECOVERY re-anchor (history is NEVER rewritten)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    At init (once per process per path; opt out with ``verify_on_init=False``
    for read-only callers) verify() runs once. If the chain is invalid, an
    error log named ``[TRACE-LEDGER-BLOCKER]`` reports the file, the first
    broken line/seq and the recovery action, then ONE explicit anchor entry
    is appended and a NEW chain segment starts from it::

        {"type": "CHAIN_RECOVERY", "seq": <max_seq + 1>,
         "broken_at_seq": <first broken seq>, "prev_hash": null,
         "hash": <fresh anchor>}

    The corrupted history stays on disk untouched as tamper evidence — never
    delete or rewrite it. verify() then validates the active segment from the
    last CHAIN_RECOVERY marker (``hash_chain_valid`` covers that segment
    only); the pre-anchor history is reported via ``history_valid`` /
    ``history_errors`` and never counted as current-chain failure.

    Unwritable/invalid ledger locations (OSError such as PermissionError or
    FileNotFoundError at init — e.g. a POSIX-style ``/tmp`` path on Windows
    resolving to ``\tmp`` at the drive root) do NOT crash construction: the
    boot check is skipped with a WARNING and ``boot_skipped=True`` is set on
    the instance. Appends then raise (fail-closed at use time) while the
    path stays unwritable. Valid writable ledgers still verify and recover
    normally at boot — no gate is weakened.

    Trust note: any writer who can append to the file can also append a fresh
    CHAIN_RECOVERY anchor. The ledger proves continuity between appends; it
    cannot defend against a writer with filesystem write access (layered
    HMAC provenance lives in scp/core/autonomous_ledger.py).
