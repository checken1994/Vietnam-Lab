[Task 19-C] ruff: noqa: F821 — this is a MIXIN module. Names like
RealityJudge, _judge_lock, AttackCrawler, start_crawl_thread,
_cross_language_learner, _V1042_AVAILABLE, DataPartitioner, ThreeTierCache,
etc. are defined in the parent api_server.py and injected at runtime via the

dependency. The noqa suppresses F821 for the entire file.

[SCP-DNA-FIX R5-1] Note: _SCP_SAFE_FETCH_UA was REMOVED from the noqa
scope above because it is now defined LOCALLY below (was the cause of the
Round 5 / Source 1+2+4 cross-validated CRITICAL bug: constant defined only
in api_server.py:73 but USED at helpers.py:258 → NameError → caught by
except Exception at api_server.py:588 → image/voice jailbreak detector

# TẠI SAO _SCP_SAFE_FETCH_UA / _is_disallowed_ip / _SafeRedirectHandler /
# _safe_fetch_url are now IMPORTED (not defined here):
#   Before: helpers.py had its OWN inline definitions of all 4 symbols, and
#   api_utils.py had a SEPARATE fetch_with_retry that bypassed all of them
#   (urllib.request.urlopen with no IP check, follows redirects). Two
#   divergent implementations of "safe URL fetch" — scanners only checked one
#   (DNA #5 ảo giác đồng thuận). DNA #14: same name "safe fetch" ≠ same
#   safety posture.
#   After: ALL 4 symbols live in scp.core.url_fetcher (neutral module, no
#   circular-dep risk). helpers.py re-exports them so existing imports
#   (api_server.py line 42, _shared.py PEP 562 delegation, v104_routes.py)
#   keep working unchanged. If you need a fetcher, extend url_fetcher.py —
#   do NOT add a third impl here.
