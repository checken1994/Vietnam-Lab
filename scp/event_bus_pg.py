"""PostgreSQL event bus — durable table + NOTIFY wake-up (Track C2).

ADOPT-AND-FIX Track C2: inter-container event delivery on PostgreSQL
(psycopg 3), following the V2 "borrow the platform" plan.

Design contract (mandatory, from the audit lesson that NOTIFY is NOT a queue):

    The durable ``scp_events`` TABLE is the source of truth. PostgreSQL
    LISTEN/NOTIFY is ONLY a wake-up bell that makes the next poll happen
    sooner. ``publish()`` commits the row and raises ``pg_notify`` inside the
    SAME transaction, so the two are atomic: an event is visible in the table
    if and only if its bell could ring. A NOTIFY that is never heard
    (listener down at publish time, restart, network blip, wake-up lost)
    loses nothing — the row is already committed and is recovered by
    ``replay_undelivered()`` (or by a subscriber started with
    ``start_at="beginning"``). Nobody may treat NOTIFY itself as delivery.

Delivery semantics:

- At-least-once per subscriber cursor. ``subscribe_poll()`` polls rows with
  ``id > cursor`` in id order, calls the handler, then marks the row
  ``delivered_at``. If the process dies between the handler call and the
  delivered-at update, the event is processed again on restart — handlers
  MUST be idempotent.
- Handler failure: logged (with traceback), the row is NOT marked delivered,
  its ``attempts`` counter is incremented, and the channel cursor does not
  advance past it (retry on the next wake-up/poll — in-order delivery with
  bounded head-of-line blocking). After ``max_attempts`` consecutive
  failures the row is marked ``dead = TRUE`` and logged at CRITICAL
  (poison-message guard), and the cursor advances past it so one poison
  payload can never block the channel forever.
- ``delivered_at`` is a channel-level acknowledgement ("at least one
  subscriber processed it"), used by ``replay_undelivered()`` to repair the
  window when a listener was down. Per-subscriber fan-out correctness comes
  from independent cursors, not from ``delivered_at``.

Security/robustness invariants:

- 100% parameterized DML: every value (including the channel string and
  notification payload) goes through bind parameters, and the LISTEN statement
  is a compile-time constant (fixed wake channel, see ``_WAKE_CHANNEL``):
  this module constructs no SQL text from variables at all — no f-strings,
  no concatenation, no psycopg sql composition. Fail-closed.
- Fail-closed: ``publish()`` never swallows an error (raise on any failure);
  a broken listen/poll connection propagates loudly (fail loudly), because
  events are durable in the table and a supervisor restart + replay is the
  recovery path, not silent reconnection.
- Channel names are validated (1-63 chars of ``[A-Za-z0-9._:-]``) so a channel
  is always safe as data (table filter + NOTIFY channel argument); DSNs are
  never logged (only a redacted form is used in messages).

# would force the SQL statement text to be built from a variable (the exact
# dynamic-SQL shape the security gate flags). The design contract above makes
# NOTIFY a pure optimization — the durable table is the source of truth and
# every poll re-filters by the subscriber's own channel — so ONE constant bell
# channel for the whole bus preserves every delivery semantic: any publish
# wakes every listener, each listener's (indexed) poll selects only its own
