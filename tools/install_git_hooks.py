"""SCP Guardrail — Install git hooks.

[M-12 fix 2026-10-01] The installer used to BLINDLY overwrite any existing
pre-commit hook (rename to pre-commit.backup + write the SCP hook). That
destroyed foreign hook content installed by other tooling. Fail-closed
behavior now:

- No existing pre-commit hook      -> install the SCP T00 tripwire hook.
- Existing hook IS the SCP hook    -> idempotent reinstall (same content,
  no backup churn, exit 0).
- Existing foreign hook            -> DO NOT touch it. Fail loudly (exit 1)
  with merge instructions so a human composes the chain.
