"""HISTORICAL — retriever coverage threshold patch (2026-08-17), already applied and retired.

This one-off patch edited scp/rag/canonical_retriever.py to raise the chunk coverage threshold from 0.6 to 0.75.
The change has long since been absorbed into the product; the
executable read-modify-write logic was retired in audit round 2
(2026-10-01) to remove dead one-off patch-tool write surfaces
(dead-path sweep A11 M-03; no test or product module imports this
file — verified 2026-10-01).

The original body remains in git history:
    git log --follow -p -- tools/patch_retriever_coverage_threshold_v1.py
"""
