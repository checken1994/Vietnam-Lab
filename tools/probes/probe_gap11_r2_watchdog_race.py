"""Round 2 Adversarial Probe: Lease Expiration Watchdog racing against commit_completed().

Tests:
1. Passive TTL expiry: commit_completed() called after lease TTL expired before watchdog runs.
2. Active watchdog expiry in VERIFYING: expire_leases() runs first -> task moves to HUMAN_REVIEW -> worker commit_completed() strictly rejected.
3. Active watchdog expiry in RUNNING: expire_leases() runs first -> task moves to RECOVERING -> worker commit_completed() strictly rejected.
4. Explicit lease revocation: release() called -> worker commit_completed() strictly rejected.
5. Fencing token staleness: Lease expired, task re-claimed by worker 2 -> worker 1 commit_completed() strictly rejected.
6. Multithreaded concurrent race: ThreadPool racing expire_leases() vs commit_completed() across multiple tasks.
