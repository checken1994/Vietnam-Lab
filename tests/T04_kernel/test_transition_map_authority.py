"""[Agent2-KernelKeeper regression 2026-09-29, round 2] Transition-map
authority: every tasks-state write must respect ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS.

The follow-up audit of 77d44816 found that commit_failed() and
set_task_kill() write the state column with raw UPDATEs that bypass the
transition map, producing journal edges that ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS forbids
(observed by direct probe at HEAD 0d61f32c):

    VERIFYING      -> CANCELLED         (via set_task_kill, kill during verify)
    RECOVERING     -> CANCELLED         (via set_task_kill, kill during recovery)
    VERIFYING      -> RETRY_SCHEDULED   (via commit_failed RETRYABLE)
    LEASED         -> UNKNOWN           (via commit_failed UNKNOWN-class)

rebuild_projection() replays the journal with NO map validation, so any
consumer re-deriving state from events silently inherits these out-of-law
edges: the map contract ("documented machine and code must agree",
scp-task-kernel-review skill) is violated by the kernel's own writers.
Fix: validate the edge against ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS inside the commit; on
violation, fail-closed by routing the decision through the nearest legal
edge preserving the safety intent (kill -> FAILED, uncertain -> RECOVERING)
and recording the reroute in the journal reason/payload. The old code fails
every test below (illegal edge committed, no reroute visible); the new code
commits only legal edges.
