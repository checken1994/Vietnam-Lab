    state (task/lease/checkpoint) and only failed at the executor PEP afterwards.
    Commit 0d13c85 (M4 FIX 2026-09-11) deliberately changed the product contract
    to fail closed: a request with no parsable capability token raises
    PermissionError (CapabilityRequiredError, FA-05) BEFORE action resolution and
    BEFORE any TaskKernel mutation. The product is correct (fail-closed, no
    kernel side effects for unauthorized callers); this test pinned the outdated
    ordering. Strictness INCREASED, no assertion loosened:
    - Leg A (new): missing token -> PermissionError AND no kernel task exists
      (deterministic task id from request_key proves zero kernel mutation).
    - Leg B (original intent preserved): WITH a valid token the executor policy
      denial is still routed to commit_failed() -> FAILED state with a
      hands:// indictment, exactly one TASK_FAILED event, actor pinned, and the
      journal hash chain still verifies.
