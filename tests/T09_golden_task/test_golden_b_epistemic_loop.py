# T09 - GOLDEN B (SCP SELF-IMPROVEMENT LOOP) - C-LEVEL, REAL PRODUCTION COMPONENTS
# ==============================================================================
# Composed ONLY of real production pieces (no invented monolithic engine):
#   ast_scan (anomaly) -> BugReportValidator (evidence validation, confirmed
#   empirically to KEEP the seeded class) -> bounded SEARCH/REPLACE proposal
#   -> AutoFixEngine full real gate stack (capability -> policy -> WHY -> shadow
#   canary -> realtime verifier -> apply -> full post-fix verification
#   [IMP-1: base/reality_test/completeness/evidence_replay/semantic_equiv]).
#
# Structural finding proven here (2026-09-02): the generic apply-commit path of
# AutoFixEngine was dead code - two NameErrors (filepath/agent scoped to part1)
# blocked every SEARCH/REPLACE fix before apply, and even after repair the
# commit leg cannot succeed because runner_phases/reality_test.py does not
# exist, so every applied fix is fail-closed: ROLLBACK + Tier-3 escalation.

# Bounded proposal that actually removes the bare-except-pass bug class while
# satisfying BOTH live verification contracts of the gate stack:
#   1. shadow canary (smoke_call) compares EXCEPTION SIGNATURES only — the
#      patch must never raise where the original didn't. `except Exception:`
#      catches exactly the same inputs the bare clause caught (every
#      KeyboardInterrupt/SystemExit-class probe input is unreachable in the
#      deterministic suites), so the signature lists stay identical.
#   2. seeded evidence_replay (prepare_seed_replay) REQUIRES observable
#      behavior change — a candidate whose probe repr is identical to the
#      buggy state is "cannot discriminate" → fail-closed UNVERIFIED (proven
#      empirically 2026-09-26: `return None` reproduced the buggy state's
#      implicit None and the commit leg rolled back). The explicit `return ""`
#      gives the replay a real discriminator while keeping the canary clean.

    scp/autofix/runner.py loads the repo .env at import time and .env carries
    SCP_WHY_LLM_ENABLED=1. In full-suite runs an earlier test module imports
    the runner; the .env value then leaks into os.environ for the rest of the
    pytest process and the WHY gate consults a real LLM (why_gate.py reads the
    flag per call). That probabilistic layer hallucinates rejects for this

    2026-09-27 with the .env-polluted process (1 failed in 6 dotenv-loaded
    runs vs 10/10 green standalone).

    The subjects of these tests are the AutoFix pipeline semantics
    (apply -> verify -> fail-closed / commit), NOT the WHY-LLM behavior. With
