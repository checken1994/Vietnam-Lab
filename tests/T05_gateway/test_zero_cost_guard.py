Architectural Deprecation of zero_cost_guard — post-deprecation verification.

FA-02 dictates that tests cannot be deleted without architectural deprecation.
These tests verify the post-deprecation state: zero_cost_guard is fully removed
and the surviving modules (egress_policy, free_catalog) still function correctly.
