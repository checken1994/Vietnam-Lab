"""Reality test for Fix 4-a-014: llm_gateway client init race condition.

Before fix: `_client` was lazily initialized with a bare check-then-set:
    if self._client is None:
        self._client = httpx.AsyncClient(...)
Two concurrent chat()/_call_model() calls could both see _client is None,
both create an httpx.AsyncClient, and one would leak (never closed).

After fix: asyncio.Lock + double-checked init. Only the first concurrent
caller creates _client; subsequent callers see it set + skip the lock
entirely (no contention on the hot path).

DNA principles exercised:
  #2  (vòng lặp khép kín — reality test of the fix, not just the fix)
  #9  (no harm — leaked httpx clients accumulate connections + FDs)
  #22 (PASS ≠ TRUE — old code "worked" but silently leaked under concurrency)
  #26 (reality test — execute + cross-check the lock pattern)
