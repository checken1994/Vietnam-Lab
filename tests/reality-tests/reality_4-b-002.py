Before fix: ground_truth contains SLM answer → entity_found = True (self-match).
After fix:  ground_truth has no SLM answer key → entity verification uses only
            structured evidence → fabricated claims without evidence →
            verified=None → R17-FIX-2 UPHOLD fires.

DNA principles exercised:
  #2  (vòng lặp khép kín — reality test of the fix, not just the fix)
  #5  (ảo giác đồng thuận — SLM is no longer its own ground truth)
  #22 (PASS ≠ TRUE — R17 fix comment no longer lies)
  #26 (reality test — concrete check, not a code review claim)
