"""Reality test for Fix 4-b-016: why_gate singleton init race eliminated.

[DNA #2/#9/#19/#22/#26]

Before fix:
  `get_why_gate()` used a broken double-checked-locking pattern:
    if _why_gate_lock is None:            # check WITHOUT holding lock
        _why_gate_lock = threading.Lock() # two threads can race here
    if _why_gate is None:                 # check WITHOUT lock
        with _why_gate_lock:
            if _why_gate is None:
                _why_gate = WhyGate(...)
  Two threads could both see `_why_gate_lock is None`, both create their
  own Lock() instance — the "losing" thread's lock would be overwritten,
  but it would still proceed to use its OWN lock (not the winner's). The
  `with _why_gate_lock:` blocks would NOT be mutually exclusive between
  threads using different locks. Both could pass the inner check, both
  initialize the singleton → two WhyGate instances (orphaned first one
  leaks the audit file handle, double audit-log writes).

  DNA #9 (No harm — orphaned WhyGate + double audit-log writes).
  DNA #22 (PASS≠TRUE — claimed singleton, actually race-conditioned).
  DNA #19 (Tầng kiểm toán — couldn't see which instance wrote which audit).

After fix:
  `_why_gate_lock` is initialized at MODULE LOAD time (atomic under
  Python's import lock). `get_why_gate()` acquires the lock BEFORE
  checking `_why_gate is None` — single critical section, no race window.
