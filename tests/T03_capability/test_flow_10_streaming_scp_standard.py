SCP Complete Standard Test — Mạch 10: Streaming
Covers: scp/api/routes/stream_routes.py (POST /v105/ask/stream)

M10 HARNESS FIX (AUDIT-20260909) — root causes of the 5 red tests:
  - STREAM-2/3/6 patched `scp.api.routes.stream_routes.stream_llm_response`
    and STREAM-4 patched `stream_routes.LLMGateway` — NEITHER attribute ever
    existed in stream_routes (the route uses the canonical get_judge()
    pipeline, not a module-level LLM gateway), so unittest.mock raised
    AttributeError before any assertion ran.
  - STREAM-5 patched `stream_routes.verify_admin` as a module attribute, but
    the route captured the dependency at decoration time
    (`dependencies=[Depends(verify_admin)]`), so the patch never applied and
    the unauthenticated request was (correctly) answered 401 auth-first,
    not 422.
  - The 6 `test_causal_*` "passed" tests were literal `pass` placeholders
    (FA-01 vacuous green) — de-vacuated below, each with its own real
    assertions over the live route.
  Rewritten: ZERO mocks — this module does not import unittest.mock and
  applies no patch(). Real admin auth (SCP_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET env + Bearer,
  same pattern as T02/M6), real HTTP streaming through TestClient
  (httpx client.stream), real judge pipeline offline (SCP_EGRESS_MODE=deny).

M10 PRODUCT fix verified by this suite (AUDIT-20260909):
  - stream_routes.ask_stream read the judge verdict as ATTRIBUTES
    (`verdict.verdict`, `verdict.confidence`, ...) while
    RealityJudge.judge() returns a plain dict -> AttributeError on EVERY
    request -> every stream ended in `step: error` and the `judge done` +
    `final` frames were never emitted. Fixed to the real dict contract
    (domain comes from the classify step; the judge result has no domain).

FA-01: Strict assertions, no loosening
FA-02: No skip/xfail
FA-03: Full pytest output as evidence
FA-04: No simulated VERIFIED
FA-05: No self-grant authority
FA-09: Exploit mandate — reproduce actual behavior
