"""
SCP Complete Standard Test — /ask world_state hook (C-S2, AUDIT-20260913).

Claim under test (arch audit 52-mảnh @9ec8d6b, commit e0696f5):
  The world_state hook in scp/api_server_parts/_ask_impl.py raised on EVERY
  judge PASS and the exception was swallowed as a warning only, so
  world_state never received a /ask record.

Root cause (evidence, scp/world_state/temporal_authority.py:91-92):
  The hook passed evidence_refs=[] while record_observation() defaults
  epistemic_status="OBSERVED"; an OBSERVED assertion REQUIRES evidence_refs
  ("unaudited world writes are forbidden") → WorldStateError on every PASS.

Fix verified here (fix at the failure point):
  1. Hook now records the pass_verdict event with evidence_refs=[run_id]
     where run_id is the request-ledger run attached to request.state.scp_run
     by the traced_request wrapper (same identity the HTTP response carries).
  2. Store failures stay fail-open for /ask (hook is auxiliary) but MUST be
     observable: warning log "[RESTORED-SYSTEMS] world_state hook failed".
  3. Happy path never raises and never logs the hook-failure warning.

FA-01: Strict assertions, no loosening
FA-02: No skip/xfail
FA-04: No simulated VERIFIED — tests 1-2 run the REAL /ask pipeline (real
       gateway transport over a real local HTTP fixture provider, real judge,
       real ledger, real world_state SQLite store); test 3 drives the REAL
       rebound _ask_impl through a real Starlette Request and relies on the
       REAL world_state store to refuse an unaudited write.
FA-09: Exploit mandate — the old bug is reproduced by construction: with
       evidence_refs=[] the store itself rejects the write (test 3 proves the
       provenance guard, test 1 proves the audited write now lands).

Fixture discipline (mirrors test_flow_02_ask_chat_scp_standard.py):
only environment/config is fixture data; no subsystem logic is mocked.
Test 3 stubs ONLY the get_judge accessor (so the hook's no-run_id defensive
branch can be driven deterministically without an answer source); the store
and the whole hook code path under test remain the production ones.
