SCP Complete Standard Test — Mạch 3: OpenAI & SWE-Bench Compatibility
Covers: api/routes/openai_compat.py, api/routes/swe_bench_routes.py

FA-01: Strict assertions, no loosening
FA-02: No skip/xfail
FA-03: Full pytest output as evidence
FA-04: No simulated VERIFIED
FA-05: No self-grant authority
FA-09: Exploit mandate - reproduce actual behavior
FA-13: Causal branch coverage of OpenAI/SWE-Bench compat flow

AUDIT-20260909 M3 root-cause ledger (circuit closure, see
docs/evidence-summary/M03-closure.json):
  - OPENAI-2 pinned 422 on an UNAUTHENTICATED request; the route is
    auth-first (get_current_user runs before body handling) → reality is 401.
    Schema validation is now asserted WITH valid auth against the OpenAI
    error envelope the product really emits (400), plus 401 auth-first pin.
  - OPENAI-5 / ERR-1 patched scp.api.routes.openai_compat.LLMGateway — an
    attribute that NEVER existed (the route runs the real RealityJudge, not
    an LLMGateway). Both now run the real pipeline; ERR-1 injects a fault at
    the route's get_judge seam for the FAILURE branch only (no real input
    reaches it — probe: docs/evidence-summary/M03-evidence/
    _probe_failure_triggers.py), and asserts the structured 503 envelope +
    no internal-message leak (product fix in this circuit).
  - SWE-1 / SWE-2 invented a top-level /chat/completions path; the product
    mounts SWE-Bench compat behind the deliberate /swe-bench/v1 prefix
    (swe_bench_routes.py). Tests pinned to the real mount point with
    strict OpenAI-shape assertions. instance_id is NOT a required field
    (accepted, ignored) — pinned as observed.
  - TRANS-4 was an async stub with a `pass` body (uncollectible without an
    async plugin). Reality: the product has NO SSE translation; stream=true
    is accepted and answered with the same single JSON completion. SSE
    output is a recorded known gap of M3, NOT simulated here.
  - OPENAI-4 / SWE-3 / TRANS-1 / TRANS-2 / TRANS-3 were `pass` stubs that
    pinned nothing; each now asserts a real, observable translation /
    envelope contract over the real pipeline.
  - ERR-2 patched swe_bench_routes.AgentOrchestrator — never existed; the
    endpoint never calls an agent orchestrator (static tool-calling stub,
    execution deferred to the agent loop). The real error path (pydantic
    422 + detail) is pinned without any mock.

NO MOCKS replace subsystem logic: the golden path in this file runs the real
RealityJudge pipeline over TestClient. The only injected fault is the
ERR-1 failure-branch injection documented above; env/config (JWT secret) is
set via monkeypatch exactly like the T02 sibling suite.
