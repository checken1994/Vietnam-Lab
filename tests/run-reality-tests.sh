# (Microsoft Store alias that exits 49 without installing Python). `command -v
# python3` finds that shim, so probing with `command -v` alone previously made
# EVERY reality test fail (0 passed / 75 failed). Only trust python3 if it can
# actually execute; otherwise fall back to `python`. SCP_PYTHON_BIN still wins.
