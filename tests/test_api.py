"""Integration check against a LIVE SCP API server on 127.0.0.1:8000.

[TQ-01 rewrite 2026-09-28] The original body swallowed every failure
(`except URLError: pass` + print-only), so the test passed even when the
server was down or the endpoint was broken ? a placebo. The contract is now:

  - server reachable  -> real HTTP response must be verified (status code
    must be an int in [200, 500) and the body must parse as JSON);
  - server not running -> explicit skip WITH reason (live-server dependency),
    never a silent pass.

This test does not start the server itself; it is a liveness probe for the
end-to-end flow, matching the R4-04 behavioral-test contract (real runtime
verification or an explicit skip ? never an unconditional pass).
